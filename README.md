## What does work
Available function for the moment are fairly limited, though the following have been made :

- Open kdbx database with password / key
- Groups/Subgroups: Listing, Add, Delete, Edit
- Entries : Listing, View, Add, Delete, Edit
- Search function for entries

## Todo
A lot more can be done !

- Move entry to another group
- Move group to another group/subgroup
- Move entry to recycled_bin when deleted
- Change password database
- Custom icons for groups

...
